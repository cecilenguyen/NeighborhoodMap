# Udacity Project 5 - Neighborhood Map

A simple map application depicting 5 locations centralized around Seattle, WA. Locations can be searched for from the left panel side bar and the markers on the map will be filtered simultaneously. Clicking on a location marker will show a Google street view as well as the address. This map application is populated using the Google Maps API and the FourSquare API.

## Download

The files for this program may be downloaded or cloned from https://github.com/cecilenguyen/NeighborhoodMap.

Use the following command in the command terminal:

`$ git clone https://github.com/cecilenguyen/NeighborhoodMap.git`

## System Requirements

Browser such as IE, Firefox, or Safari

You may need [Python 3.6.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run the application on a sample server if you encounter CORS issues.

## Quick Start

After downloading or cloning the program files, open the directory the files are downloaded to. Double click the index.html file and it should open the webpage in your default browser.

You can also load the webpage by copying and pasting the filepath of portfolio.html into your browser's address bar.

If you encounter cross origin issues, you can run the application on a local server. Open a command prompt and navigate to the location of the Neighborhood Map code. Run the command `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. In your browser, type "localhost:8000" into the navigation bar. The application should now run on that port.
